                <h2>Problem statement: Decoration Previewer</h2>
                <p>
                    Many people end up dissapointed when the decorations they buy end up not matching with their rooms and want a way to be able to test how the decorations will look before commiting to a purchase. Our solution is to allow users to see how the decorations will look in their room before buying them.

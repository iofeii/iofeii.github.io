                    Decoration Design<br>
                    Authors: Evan Trauger, Kelvin Iriarte, and Zephanae Liis<br>
                    Problem Statement<br>
                        Many people end up disappointed when the decorations they buy end up not matching with their rooms and want a way to be able to test how the decorations will look before committing to a purchase. Our solution is allow users to see how the decorations will look in their room before buying them.<br>
                    Who is experiencing this problem?<br>
                        People that are decorating their house.<br>
                    What is the problem?<br>
                        Many people buy decorations without first knowing how they will look in their houseâ€”potentially leading them to buy decorations that do not match the decorations they already have.
                    Where does this problem present itself?<br>
                        Typically when people are buying items online or even in person.<br>
                    Why does it matter?<br>
                        Being able to view beforehand what decorations someone is considering buying will allow them to avoid buying the wrong decorations and save them the hassle and money.<br>

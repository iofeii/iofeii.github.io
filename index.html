                <h2>Problem statement: Decoration Previewer</h2>
                <p>
                    Our users are frustrated because it is hard to envision how decorations would look in a space or with other decorations which makes decoration purchase decisions difficult. Our solution is to provide users with a way to visualize decorations in a space before buying.

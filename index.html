                    Authors: Evan Trauger, Kelvin Iriarte, and Zephanae Liis
                    Problem Statement
                        Many people end up disappointed when the decorations they buy end up not matching with their rooms and want a way to be able to test how the decorations will look before committing to a purchase. Our solution is allow users to see how the decorations will look in their room before buying them.
                    Who is experiencing this problem?
                        People that are decorating their house.
                    What is the problem?
                        Many people buy decorations without first knowing how they will look in their houseâ€”potentially leading them to buy decorations that do not match the decorations they already have.
                    Where does this problem present itself?
                        Typically when people are buying items online or even in person.
                    Why does it matter?
                        Being able to view beforehand what decorations someone is considering buying will allow them to avoid buying the wrong decorations and save them the hassle and money.
